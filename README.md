## The main objective of this Project is :
**-> To build a training model including physiological signals (EEG signals from the dataset) useful for detecting emotions with the help of machine and deep learning!**

At first, I have collected EEG signals dataset in csv format as shown in emotions.csv.
after collecting data, i've preprocessed it and applied Random Forest Classifier (MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHM)  which gave an accuracy of 98% and a recurrent neural network (DEEP LEARNING) which gave an accuracy of 96%.
